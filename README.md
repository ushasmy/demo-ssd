# 🌱 Household Sustainability System

A full-stack sustainability platform that helps households monitor energy usage, report electricity issues, manage waste, access disaster alerts, use a green marketplace, and receive AI-powered sustainability recommendations.

# 🚀 Deployment Guide

This project uses a split deployment setup:

- **Backend** is hosted on **Render**
- **Frontend** is hosted on **Vercel**

This setup allows the frontend and backend to be deployed independently while still working together as one full-stack application.
---

## 🧩 How Deployment Works

The system is deployed in two parts:

### 1. Frontend on Vercel
The frontend contains the user interface of the application.  
It is responsible for:

- showing pages and dashboards
- handling navigation
- collecting user input
- sending requests to the backend API

When a user opens the website, they are using the frontend hosted on Vercel.

### 2. Backend on Render
The backend contains the server-side logic and API endpoints.  
It is responsible for:

- authentication and authorization
- database operations
- handling business logic
- processing user requests
- returning data to the frontend

When the frontend needs data, it sends a request to the backend hosted on Render.

---

## 🔁 Request Flow

The deployment flow works like this:

1. The user opens the frontend on Vercel
2. The frontend sends API requests to the Render backend
3. The backend processes the request
4. The backend connects to the database and returns a response
5. The frontend displays the returned data to the user

In simple terms:

**User → Vercel Frontend → Render Backend → Database → Frontend → User**

---

## ⚙️ Why Use Render for Backend and Vercel for Frontend

This project uses two platforms because each one is well suited for a different part of the system.

### Render is used for the backend because:
- it is suitable for hosting Node.js/Express backend services
- it supports environment variables securely
- it can redeploy automatically when code is pushed
- it is easy to connect with GitHub repositories

### Vercel is used for the frontend because:
- it is very convenient for deploying modern frontend applications
- it supports fast frontend builds and updates
- it works well with GitHub-based deployment
- it automatically creates production deployments from the connected project

---

## 🛠️ Deployment Process

### Backend Deployment on Render
The backend is deployed by connecting the GitHub repository to Render as a Web Service.

Basic process:
1. Connect the GitHub repository to Render
2. Select the backend service or backend root folder
3. Add environment variables in Render dashboard
4. Set build and start commands
5. Deploy the backend
6. Render provides a live backend URL

### Frontend Deployment on Vercel
The frontend is deployed by connecting the same GitHub repository to Vercel.

Basic process:
1. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Select the frontend root folder
3. Add environment variables if needed
4. Set the frontend framework/build settings
5. Deploy the frontend
6. Vercel provides a live frontend URL

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Sensitive values such as API keys, database URLs, and secrets are not stored directly in the source code.

Instead:
- backend environment variables are configured in **Render**
- frontend environment variables are configured in **Vercel**

This makes the deployment more secure and easier to manage across different environments.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

After the hosting platforms are connected to GitHub:

- pushing backend changes can trigger a new backend deployment on Render
- pushing frontend changes can trigger a new frontend deployment on Vercel

This helps keep the live application updated with the latest code changes.

---

## ✅ Summary

This project uses a modern full-stack deployment strategy:

- **Frontend** is deployed on **Vercel**
- **Backend** is deployed on **Render**
- both services are connected through API communication
- GitHub is used as the source for deployment
- environment variables are managed securely in each platform

This deployment approach makes the system easier to maintain, update, and scale.
